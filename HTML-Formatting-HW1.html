    <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy <u>text</u> of the printing and typesetting industry.</p>
    <p><i><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong></i><i> has been the industry's standart dummy text ever since the <mark>1500s</mark>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</i></p>
    <p>it has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. it was popularised in the <mark>1970s</mark> with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
    Lorem ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <s><strong>Aldus PageMaker</strong></s> including versions of Lorem Ipsum </P>
